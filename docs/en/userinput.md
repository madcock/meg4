<h2 ui_gp>Gamepad</h2>

The first gamepad's buttons and joysticks are mapped to the keyboard, they are working simultaniously. For example it doesn't
matter if you press ‚ìç on the controller, or <kbd>X</kbd> on the keyboard, in both case both gamepad button flag and keyboard
state flag will be set. The mapping can be changed by writing the keyboard scancodes to MEG-4's memory, see [memory map] for
details. The default mapping goes like cursor arrows are the directions ‚óÅ, ‚ñ≥, ‚ñΩ, ‚ñ∑; the <kbd>Space</kbd> is the primary
button ‚í∂, <kbd>C</kbd> is the secondary button ‚í∑ and <kbd>X</kbd> is ‚ìç, <kbd>Z</kbd> is ‚ìé. The Konami Code is working too
(see `KEY_CHEAT` scancode).

<h2 ui_ptr>Pointer</h2>

Coordinates and button pressed states can be easily accessed from the MEG-4's memory. Scrolling (both vertical and if supported,
horizontal) handled as if your mouse had up / down or left / right buttons.

<h2 ui_kbd>Keyboard</h2>

For convenience, it has several shortcuts and multiple input methods.

### UNICODE Codepoint Mode

In this mode you can enter hex numbers (`0` to `9` and `A` to `F`). Instead of these separately pressed keys, the codepoint they
describe will be added as if your keyboard had that key. For example the sequence <kbd>GUI</kbd>, <kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>e</kbd>,
<kbd>‚èéEnter</kbd> will add a `.` dot, because codepoint `U+0002E` is the `.` dot character.

NOTE: Only the Basic Multilingual Plane (`U+00000` to `U+0FFFF`) supported, with some exceptions for the emoticons range starting
at `U+1F600`. Other codepoints will be simply skipped.

This mode automatically quits after the characterer is entered.

### Compose Mode

In compose mode you can add acute, umlaut, tilde etc. to the characters. For example the sequence <kbd>AltGr</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>,
<kbd>'</kbd> will add `√°`, or <kbd>AltGr</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>s</kbd> will add `√ü`, and another example, <kbd>AltGr</kbd>,
<kbd>c</kbd>, <kbd>,</kbd> will add `√ß`, etc. You can use <kbd>Shift</kbd> in combination with the letter to get the uppercase
variants.

This mode automatically quits after the characterer is entered.

### Icon Mode

In icon mode you can add special icon characters, representing the emulator's input (like the sequence <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>,
<kbd>m</kbd> will add the `üñ±` mouse icon, and <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd> will add the icon of the gamepad's
`‚í∂` button) as well as emoji icons (like <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd>;</kbd>, <kbd>)</kbd> will add the character `üòâ`,
or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>, <kbd><</kbd>, <kbd>3</kbd> will produce `‚ù§`).

This mode remains active after the characterer is entered, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return to normal input mode.

### Katakana and Hiragana Modes

Similar to icon mode, but here you can type the Romaji letters of pronounced sound to get the character. For example the sequence
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd>, <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>i</kbd>, <kbd>k</kbd>, <kbd>a</kbd> is interpreted
as three sounds, and therefore will add the three characters `„Éä„Éã„Éµ`. Also, punctation works as expected, for example
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>.</kbd> will produce Japanese full stop character `„ÄÇ`.

You can use <kbd>Shift</kbd> in combination with the first letter to get the uppercase variants, for example
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>s</kbd>, <kbd>u</kbd> will produce `„Çπ` and not `„á≤`.

This mode remains active after the characterer is entered, press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to return to normal input mode.

NOTE: This feature is implemented using data tables, new combinations and even new writing systems can be added to `src/inp.c`
any time without coding skills.
